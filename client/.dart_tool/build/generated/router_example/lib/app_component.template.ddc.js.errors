Unable to find modules for some sources, this is usually the result of either a
bad import, a missing dependency in a package (or possibly a dev_dependency
needs to move to a real dependency), or a build failure (if importing a
generated file).

Please check the following imports:

`import 'src/hero/hero_service.dart';` from router_example|lib/app_component.dart at 5:1
`import 'src/hero/hero_service.dart' as import22;` from router_example|lib/app_component.template.dart at 33:1
